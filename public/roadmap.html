        <h2>Fiat on/off ramp</h2>
        <p>
          We are integrating the Changelly Fiat API so you can buy or sell TON directly inside the wallet. Identity verification and
          payment processing remain on the provider’s side, while funds land in the same secure vault.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Open modules</h2>
        <p>
          After the DEX adapters stabilize, we will publish them in a dedicated public repository. This will let integrators reuse the
          modules, file issues, and ship their own improvements with full transparency.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Additional platforms</h2>
        <p>
          Native mobile shells—and a browser extension if needed—are planned once the current security and audit checklist is cleared.
          The same protections and flows will carry over to every device.

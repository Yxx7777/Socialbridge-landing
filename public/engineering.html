        <h1>Engineering Approach</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Socialbridge is delivered through repeatable guardrails: modular packages, pre-flight simulations, portable design tooling, and a growing automated test lab.

        <h2>Architecture guardrails</h2>
        <p>
          The wallet ships as a modular stack of packages (core, domain, network, crypto runtime) so presentation layers stay thin and replaceable. Strict capability
          injection keeps secrets inside the vault—keys never hop into UI code, and sensitive calls flow through dedicated adapters only.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear separation of vault logic, blockchain drivers, and experience layer</li>
          <li>Definition-of-done checklists for every module before it reaches users</li>
          <li>Architecture Decision Records capture each guardrail for future audits</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Pre-flight simulation & risk gates</h2>
        <p>
          Before a TON transaction is broadcast, the wallet replays it through a sandbox virtual machine and TonAPI emulation. Users see final balances, money paths, and
          excess refunds before approving.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Composite emulator (Sandbox + TonAPI) for accuracy and speed</li>
          <li>Money-path inspector shows every hop, return, and jetton mint</li>
          <li>Risk engine issues bounce verdicts and compensation hints in plain language</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Theme & interface studio</h2>
        <p>
          A standalone theme editor manipulates runtime tokens, grids, and GPU shaders so partners can reskin the wallet or embed the editor inside their own apps. Layout
          constraints mirror design tools, enabling rapid brand-ready launches.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Live editing of typography, icon sets, surfaces, and motion textures</li>
          <li>Portable editor package drops into any project with the same token schema</li>
          <li>Runtime CSS variable graph keeps design changes atomic and reversible</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Quality discipline</h2>
        <p>
          The project currently runs 337 automated tests across vault logic, DeFi flows, and UI contracts. Every feature ships with a prompt log, checklist, and rollback
          plan so regressions are easy to detect and unwind.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unit, integration, and scenario suites cover swaps, staking, and risk gates</li>
          <li>Prompt cookbooks and LEGO-style plans document each major refactor</li>
          <li>Release notes track what changed, why it changed, and how to revert safely</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security-first vault</h2>
        <p>
          Socialbridge keeps private keys on your device inside an encrypted vault, so
          only you can authorize access. Nothing ever leaves your hardware unless you
          explicitly export an encrypted backup.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>End-to-end on-device storage with secure enclave support</li>
          <li>Vault unlock secured with hardware-backed PINs</li>
          <li>Non-custodial by design: we never see seeds or passphrases</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>TON Connect + multi-account</h2>
        <p>
          Connect to TON dApps in one tap and keep multiple profiles ready for swaps,
          collections, or testing. Each account carries its own limits, jettons, and NFTs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Native TON Connect flow without manual address sharing</li>
          <li>Fast account switching with per-profile preferences</li>
          <li>Unified asset view spanning TON, jettons, and collectibles</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Built-in DeFi flows</h2>
        <p>
          Run swaps, add liquidity, or stake without leaving the wallet. Every flow is
          emulated via sandbox/TON API before you hit send, so outcomes are clear.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preview final amounts, fees, and pool deltas before execution</li>
          <li>Automated risk gates flag slippage or suspicious params</li>
          <li>One approval to broadcast the verified transaction</li>
        </ul>
